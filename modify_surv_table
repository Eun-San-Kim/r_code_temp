#When drawing the graph of the Survival analysis, the survminer package is used mainly.
However, unlike ggplot, the survminer is a little less modifiable according to the situation.
Especially, I found that there was almost no information about modifying risk table.
So I made the code for it.#

library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(dplyr)

#I start with ovarian data in survival pacakge. I create graph object named as 'surv_plot#

data(ovarian)

fit<-survfit(Surv(futime,fustat) ~ rx, data=ovarian)

surv_plot<-ggsurvplot(fit, data=ovarian, fun="event", risk.table=TRUE)

surv_plot

surv_plot$table

#I want delete 300 in time. You have to create another risk table to modify the table.
As far as I know, extracting table from main graph and applying changes doesn't work.
You can create table with ggsurvtable function
When you filter out only time with 0, 600, 900 and 1200, the no. at risk in table will be deleted#

surv_table<-ggsurvtable(surv_plot$table$data%>%filter(time %in% c(0,600,900,1200)))

#You can change the theme of table with theme of main graph#

surv_table$risk.table$theme<-surv_plot$table$theme

#...or it is possible to adapt changes#

surv_table$risk.table$labels$y<-c("Group")
surv_table$risk.table$labels$title<-c("No. without Recovery")

#You have to apply changes with scale_x_continous to modify x axis. the filter function in 27th row only works for no. at risk#

surv_table$risk.table<-surv_table$risk.table+scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,600,900,1200),labels=c(0,600,900,1200))
surv_table$risk.table

#Finally, you can adapt changes with created table#

surv_plot$table<-surv_table$risk.table

surv_plot
